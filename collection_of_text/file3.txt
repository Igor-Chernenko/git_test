It's been a bit
Since I've had words that fit
Rhyming and cadence, or meter
If that makes sense
But unlike an open register
This feeling makes no sense At all
Why do I feel.. undeniable but yet so small
So short despite the fact that I'm average height
Unwanted yet charismatic
Alone but with so many friends near and far all at once
What is this?
I can't make heads or tails of this
Now I know how two face feels before a crime
Let fate decide
But why? Where has this arisen from?
