Cacophony
Cracks the silence
as phantom pains
& unseen wounds
overwhelm one's floodgates
torn open by unexpected loss
You knew not existed..The best years of my life
Are now long gone
Chasing a ghost
that does not want to be foundIt's been a bit
Since I've had words that fit
Rhyming and cadence, or meter
If that makes sense
But unlike an open register
This feeling makes no sense At all
Why do I feel.. undeniable but yet so small
So short despite the fact that I'm average height
Unwanted yet charismatic
Alone but with so many friends near and far all at once
What is this?
I can't make heads or tails of this
Now I know how two face feels before a crime
Let fate decide
But why? Where has this arisen from?i just don't feel like smiling
but i can be nice
sometimes
it's august
used to be july
stating the obvious
isn't a crime
neither is smiling
once in a while
take a look
inside my mind
you'll see how
august
turns to julyWhile on borrowed time,
We wasted our minutes 
For the things that did not matter.
